Build and Run Instructions

Install dependencies:

npm install

Build the TypeScript code:

npm run build

Start the server in production:

npm start

Start the server in development mode (with auto-reload):

npm run dev

Key TypeScript Features Added

Strong Typing: All interfaces and types are properly defined
Type Safety: Socket.IO events are fully typed with proper client/server event interfaces
Error Handling: Custom validation errors with proper typing
Modular Architecture: Code is split into logical modules with clear responsibilities
Null Safety: Strict null checks prevent runtime errors
Generic Types: Proper use of generics for Socket.IO server configuration
Input Validation: Runtime validation with TypeScript type guards
Documentation: Better IntelliSense support and code documentation

The TypeScript version provides much better developer experience with autocompletion, compile-time error checking, and better maintainability. The modular structure also makes it easier to test and extend the functionality.

## Prompts given for HTML game

- Can you create a game for me where the player uses the mouse or cursor keys to move it's icon and collect various materials in the playing field. the player should be able to grab the items and bring them to a center field. when they deliver items to the center, the player gets points. materials have different point-values. The game space should be 3d, fixed viewpoint. Make it colourful.
- can you change it to have a isometric view, camera fixed on player
- it doens't work, i can't move the player or see items
- still doens't work. i see the ground tiles. after waiting a while i do see the ground tiles and a diamond and what looks like a shadow? but i can't move it with arrow keys or wasd
- it works! do you have improvements in mind ?

### Output after last prompt:

Major Improvements:
Combo System - Quick deliveries build up combo multipliers for bonus points
Rarity System - Materials have different spawn rates, rare ones worth more and glow brighter
Particle Effects - Score popups, pickup effects, and combo celebrations
Minimap - Shows your position, materials, and the center platform
High Score - Persistent high score saved in browser storage
Visual Polish - Speed trails, combo glows, enhanced lighting effects
Better Ground - Distance-based ground tile opacity for depth
Enhanced UI - Better styled interface with background panels
New Mechanics:
Deliver materials quickly (within 3 seconds) to build combo chains
Rare materials (Diamond, Emerald) spawn less frequently but are worth much more
Combo affects player glow and platform glow
Particle system shows score gains and effects
Minimap helps you locate distant materials
The game now has much more depth and replay value!

## Prompts for backend

- given this game, generated by you (see attached html). Would you be able to create a backend api for this which allows multiplayer games using websockets to live update the other players actions ?
- can you convert the server code to use typescript instead, adding proper typing as well ?
